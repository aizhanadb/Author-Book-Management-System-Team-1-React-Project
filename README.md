### Kick Off Meeting

- Determined the necessary points and tasks.
- Tech Lead is going to be Aizhan, Scrum Master is going to be Çağatay Şensoy
- Instead of dividing into teams, we will work on project together. The aim to share all knowledge with each other.

**Gist and Tasks:**

1. Add login form.

- Use email and password
- Bonus: permission based (user A can not create/update/delete other users and other users books)

2. Add ability to view books. Click name -> /users/1/books

3. Add ability to create/update/delete books.

4. Form validations:

```
- title: required
- genre: optional
- description: required
- isbn: required (must be 8 chars length or less)
- edition: required
```

5. Add the ability to leave a review for each book. Text Rating 1-5

6. Add ability to filter books by:

- title
- isbn
- genre

7. Add pagination to users and books. 10 users/books per page

> What we practiced ?

- Fetch API calls, send data to API for creating, deleting and updating
- Logged in feature with verification on API data calls.
- Users logged in can change only own data, can not access other users' data.
- Route used for linked between components
- Conditional rendering
- Hooks, useState, useEffect, useContext
- Loading feature
- Arrow functions
- Rendering list data with map
- Filtering data
- setState callbacks
- Context API
- Project structure
- Create, update and delete functionality for components
- Before remove user, modal opens and asking for confirmation
- Components management
- Search functionality
- Used formik for store values and trigger the sending new values to API
- User static star rating- data and showing it on UI and change on API

> Tech Used

1. Formik
2. React Router
3. useReducer
4. Context Api
5. Material UI
6. Try to use useQuery instead of useEffect
7. React strap
8. React-icons
9. Moment for the dates
10. Axios
11. Bootstrap
12. Font-awesome
13. React-icons
14. Context API

> Challenges:

- Copy the all users and searching on that
- With updating , use formik
- Create Route for conditional rendering
- Create log out and alert message -
- Books page appears before fetching/Loading doesn't function, tried many ways to solve it (our guess is that is because of react router and it's link)
- Failed to fetch the data from Nested Rating api (response was only for one book)
- Struggled to get clicked user's data from within Books component
- Fetching book review- user static star rating- data and showing it on UI, for solution, an empty array with numbers was created and then, this array was mapped and conditional rendering was created.

> Enjoy

- Create Route
- Running child for loader
- Working with real users
- Create static star rating render logic

> Unfinished

1. Add ability to filter books by:
